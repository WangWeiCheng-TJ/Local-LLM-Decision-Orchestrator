# Job Description: Lead Research Scientist (Privacy-Preserving AI)

**Company:** NeuroSentry AI
**Location:** Zurich, Switzerland (Hybrid)
**Employment Type:** Full-time

### **About Us**
NeuroSentry AI is a Series B startup backed by top-tier European VCs. We are revolutionizing the physical security industry by replacing invasive surveillance feeds with **Physically-Aware Synthetic Data**. Our mission is to protect individual privacy while maintaining the analytical utility of video streams for smart cities.

We are a team of researchers and engineers who reject the status quo. We don't maintain 10-year-old spaghetti code; we build cutting-edge generative engines from scratch.

### **The Role**
We are looking for a **Lead Research Scientist** to spearhead our "Privacy-First Vision" team. You will be responsible for designing and deploying novel deep learning architectures that can anonymize video streams in real-time using diffusion models and heavy optimization.

**What you will do:**
* Lead the R&D of our core **Video-to-Video Translation** pipeline, focusing on temporal consistency and photorealism.
* Research and implement **Self-Supervised Learning** techniques to reduce our dependency on labeled datasets.
* Optimize model inference times on edge devices (NVIDIA Jetson / Orin).
* Collaborate with the engineering team to deploy research code into production. **Note: This is a hands-on role; you will own your code from Jupyter Notebook to Docker container.**
* Publish your findings in top-tier conferences (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV) representing NeuroSentry.

### **Requirements**
* **Ph.D.** in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related field with a focus on Computer Vision or Generative AI.
* **4+ years** of post-PhD experience in industrial research or applied science labs.
* Deep expertise in **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** or **Diffusion Models**.
* Strong proficiency in **PyTorch** and **C++**. Experience with **CUDA kernels** is a massive plus.
* A "Hacker" mindset: You prefer building novel solutions over tweaking existing APIs.
* **Privacy-Awareness:** Demonstrated understanding of differential privacy or privacy-preserving ML techniques.

### **Nice to Have**
* Experience with Audio-Visual learning or Multimodal fusion.
* Previous experience in a high-growth startup environment.
* Willingness to participate in a rotating on-call schedule for critical model deployments.

### **What We Offer**
* **Competitive Salary:** CHF 180,000 – CHF 250,000 base salary.
* **Equity:** Significant stock option package (VSOP).
* **Relocation Support:** Comprehensive package for moving to Zurich.
* **Tech Gear:** MacBook Pro M3 Max and unlimited cloud compute budget.
* **Culture:** Flat hierarchy, no micromanagement, and a "Solver-First" mentality.
