# Task: Strategic Synthesis
Your job is to resolve conflicts and create a **Unified Modification Plan**.

## Conflict Resolution Rules
1. **Tech vs HR:** For this technical role, prioritize **Tech Lead (E2)** and **Architect (E6)** on content depth. Use **HR (E1)** only for tone and formatting.
2. **Safety vs Risk:** If **Strategist (E3)** warns about Tax/Visa risks, that takes precedence over **Startup Vet (E8)**'s optimism.
3. **Consistency:** Ensure the resume doesn't look schizophrenic (like it was written by 8 different people).

## Output Requirement
Return a JSON object containing the `final_plan`.

**Output Schema:**
```json
{
  "editor_summary": "string (Explain your strategy: who did you listen to and why?)",
  "final_action_items": [
    {
      "section": "Experience / Skills / Summary",
      "action": "REWRITE / ADD / DELETE",
      "draft_content": "string (The polished, final text ready to copy-paste)",
      "rationale": "string (e.g., Merged E2's technical keyword with E5's research impact)"
    }
  ]
}
